- **Author:** Olli Sorjonen
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/o-l-l-i](https://github.com/o-l-l-i)
- **X:** [https://x.com/Olmirad](https://x.com/Olmirad)
- **Version:** 1.0.1 (Restructuring code, new features)
- **NOTE:** New added fields will break the node in graphs, so use caution!

The **Olm Resolution Picker** is a lightweight, customizable resolution selector node for ComfyUI.
It allows you to define your preferred image resolutions using a simple `resolutions.txt` file â€” making it future-proof, editable, and great for organized workflows.

This node is built for users who want more than just a few hardcoded presets, or who don't want to have a huge node pack just to get a resolution selector. Whether you're targeting SDXL aspect ratios, cinematic dimensions, or mobile previews, this node makes resolution management intuitive and scalable.

## âœ¨ Features

- Outputs resolution as `width` and `height` integers
  - **User-editable `resolutions.txt`** for full control
  - Supports **labels** (e.g., `768x1344: vertical (9:16)`)
  - Allows **group headers** using `-- Header:` syntax
  - Skips invalid lines or malformed input automatically
  - Built-in fallback resolution to prevent broken graph evaluation
- Responsive, scaling UI
- Aspect Ratio Visualization:
  - Optionally toggle a preview image to better understand image composition and framing at a given resolution
- Checkerboard Overlay:
  - Helps visually estimate scale â€” tile size remains constant regardless of resolution, giving a quick sense of dimensions
- Replaceable Preview Image:
  - Swap test_image.png in the nodeâ€™s "js" directory to use your own visual reference
- Preview image can be disabled completely if needed
- Swap dimension feature
  - swap width with height for easy portrait to landscape
- Custon resolution mode allows numeric input of resolution
- Custom resolution snap feature
  - Snap to divisible by 1,2,4,8,16,32,64

## Installation

Clone this repository to your ComfyUI/custom_nodes folder.

2. Check/install dependencies.

### Most likely you don't need to do this:
You should already have all of the dependencies installed if you have ComfyUI up and running. Remember to always active the virtual environment (venv) before installing anything.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Your folder structure should look like:

```
ComfyUI/
â””â”€â”€ custom_nodes/
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€ ComfyUI-Olm-Resolution-Picker/
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ init.py
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ olm_resolution_picker.py
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ resolutions.txt
```

Restart ComfyUI after installation.

## Usage

1. Add the **Olm Resolution Picker** node in your ComfyUI graph.
2. Pick a resolution from the dropdown, toggle visualizations on/off.
3. Define resolutions in the `resolutions.txt` file (see example below).
4. The selected resolution is returned as `width` and `height` (INT, INT).
5. Safe fallback to `1024x1024` if the selection is invalid or a header is selected.

## How the resolutions.txt Configuration Works

Have a `resolutions.txt` file in the same folder as the node.
I have provided an example/default file.
The format is following:

```
// First comment
-- SDXL
1024x1024: square (1:1)
768x1344: vertical (9:16)

// Second comment
-- Cinematic
1536x640: landscape (12:5)
1564x670: cinematic (21:9)
```

- Each entry becomes selectable in a dropdown.
- The node parses only valid `WxH` resolutions and ignores malformed entries.
- A resolution entry is defined by `[width number][x][height number]`.
- Labels after `:` are shown in the UI but ignored for output.
- Use `--` to add a header.
- Use `//` for comments, these are not shown anywhere.

## Customizing the Test Image

The preview panel includes a small test image to help visualize the selected aspect ratio and cropping.

If you'd like to use your own image:

- Locate the `test_image.png` file inside the `js/` folder of this node's directory.
- Replace it with any image of your choice (a `.png` file as it's hard-coded).
- The preview area assumes a 4:3 aspect ratio (e.g., 1024x768), so images that match this ratio will display best without blank areas.

## Notes

This is a personal learning project (v1), created to explore custom node development in ComfyUI. While I took care to ensure it functions properly and it has functioned fine in my own use, there may still be bugs, rough edges, or unexpected behavior - so use with caution.

Feedback is welcome! Feel free to open an issue if you encounter a problem or have suggestions or ideas to improve the node.
